R. and J. Beck. Although it has been in use for over 16 years, it has not previously been described. The arrangement of the parts is so designed that the specimen to be cut will remain frozen for a much longer time after ceasing to work the bellows than is usually the case. Scarcely any ether is wasted, as the unevaporated and recondensed ether drops back into the reservoir; the only waste being that which passes out with the air ; morever, an object as large as 2 in.in diameter can be successfully frozen, thus enabling such a specimen as a whole eye to be cut into sections without any difficulty. The ether is introduced into the main chamber by unscrewing the funnel cap D (fig. 30), and the box B may be replenished, if required, during use. The bellows are attached at the end of tube L, which communicates directly with the nozzle C ; the distance of C below the freezing plate A is adjustable, so that the ether may be sprayed over a large or small surface, according to the size of a section under the knife. After a few minutes working the whole of the ether in B will become almost as cold as the freezing-plate ; and to utilise this cold as much as possible, a tube F fixed to the freezing -plate passes down into the ether as in B, and thus equalises the low temperature over the whole of the large plate A much more efficiently than could be the case if only a single point were the source of the cold. The freezing-plate A and the tube F are insulated effectually form the rest of the metal-work by the solid vulcanite  carrier G. The various are detachable for convenience of cleaning. The air from the bellows , after issuing form C, passes with its ether vapour through holes in the top of the tube F, and thence out of the box by the tube K. Any superfluous ether, as well as the water separated from from the ether, may be drawn off by means of the tap E."}}}},{"key":"details","value":{"keywords":"cooler, freezer, ether, Delepine Ether Freezing Box"}},{"key":"review","value":""},{"started_at":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 03:15:55 GMT","finished_at":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 03:34:41 GMT"},{"user_agent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1;
