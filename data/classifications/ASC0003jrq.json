This is inserted in a larger vessel with a broad rim at the neck. The two rims fit together closely, and seal the larger vessel. The latter is filled to a convenient level with absolute alcohol, the smaller contains the object with a little of the weak alcohol in which it previously lay. A gradual diffusion occurs and a very perfect dehydration is rapidly effected. The process may be made more gradual by the use of a double tube, the outer containing weaker alcohol. At the food of the large vessel is a layer of burnt sulphate of copper which prevents the dilution of the absolute alcohol. The dehydration of the inner tube containing the object may be conveniently tested (after twenty-four hours or so) by removing a little of the fluid in a pointed pipette, and allowing a drop to pass slowly into a test-tube with 98' alcohol. If the fluid be absolute alcohol, a small portion from the pipette will be detected passing upwards, or downwards if the fluid be below 98'. Prof. Schulze also describes a modification of a method of securing the safe preparation of delicate objects by allowing them to sink through layers of different fluids. In his improved form a closed tube contains an inferior layer of Canada balsam, above that 3 c.cm. of xylol, and uppermost 1 c.cm. of absolute alcohol. At the level of the Canada balsam there is a cock for allowing the upper layers to flow off, after which the object is removed from the Canada Balsam into which it has sunk. \n\nEfficiency of the Micrometer-screw.* --Herr J.
